# MakeReign Monorepo

A pnpm/npm workspaces monorepo for the MakeReign web platform.

## Apps

### `apps/section-marketplace`
The MakeReign Section Library. A Next.js 15 app that:

- Stores reusable React/JSX sections in `library/sections/<category>/<slug>/`
- Stores full page templates in `library/templates/<slug>/`
- Generates a `library/index.json` manifest via `library/scripts/build-manifest.mjs`
- Renders a marketplace UI to browse and preview sections + templates
- Deploys to its own Vercel project

The existing **Excellence Awards** site is included as a template at `library/templates/excellence-awards/`.

### `apps/mr-web-builder`
The MakeReign Web Builder. A Next.js 15 app that provides the UI for:

- Browsing sections from the section library
- Composing pages by combining sections
- Editing design tokens, styling, and animations
- Deploys to its own Vercel project

## Shared Packages

### `packages/canonical-stack`
Motion runtime (GSAP, Lenis, ScrollTrigger) plus the `<Section>` primitive that every library section is built on.

### `packages/section-library-ui`
Shared UI chrome reused by the marketplace and the web builder (cards, nav, theme tokens).

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19
- JavaScript / JSX (TypeScript may be adopted later, per-package)
- Tailwind CSS v4 with `@theme` design tokens (in new apps)
- GSAP for motion, Lenis for smooth scroll
- npm workspaces

## Workflows

```bash
npm install                  # install all workspace deps
npm run dev:marketplace      # run section-marketplace locally
npm run dev:builder          # run mr-web-builder locally
npm run build                # build all apps
npm run library:manifest     # regenerate library/index.json
```

## Deployment

Each app deploys as a separate Vercel project. In each Vercel project, set the **Root Directory** to either `apps/section-marketplace` or `apps/mr-web-builder`.
